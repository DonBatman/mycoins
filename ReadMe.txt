This mod will add bitcoins to your map, (NOT REAL BITCOINS) but the basic idea of bitcoins..

My first mod for minetest, I plan to expand this mod a bit more as time permits..



Tested on both stable and development releases of Minetest with no other mods, no issues were found.

please contact me by the above email if you have any issues with adding or using this mod.



Installation:

Copy the bitcoin folder to the mod folder and begin mining bitcoins...

Noet: The following recipes also include a fee (top right corner) for the conversion of all denominations into Bitcoins,
Bitcents to bitcoins can only be traided up and not down. <- may change if needed.
